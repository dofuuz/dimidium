# Dimidium

Dimidium is a standard-looking terminal color scheme, adjusted to have uniform visibility across all colors.

It aims to be a solid default for terminals.

## Crafting Dimidium

By adjusting traditional color scheme, Dimidium solves visibility issues while preserving their essence.

### Color Appearance Model

Crafted with [CAM16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_appearance_model#CAM16), it considers the perceptual aspects(lightness, hue) of human color vision.

### Half lightness disparity

(Top: Before adjustment / Bottom: Dimidium)

By reducing perceptual lightness differences by half, common issues such as too dark blues and excessively vibrant greens have been resolved.

(Note: 'Dimidium' is Latin for 'half'.)

### Uniform hue difference

Hue differences were equalized to maximize color variation.

Introducing hue offsets between normal/bright colors ensures even better distinction.
